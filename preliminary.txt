Introduction
 
We
 
chose
 
the
 
“Intentional
 
Homicide
 
Victims”
 
crime
  
dataset
 
compiled
 
by
 
the
 
United
 
Nations
 
Office
 
on
 
Drugs
 
and
 
Crime
 
(UNODC)
 
and
 
disseminated
 
via
 
the
 
UNODC
 
Data
 
Portal.
 
 
Scope
 
&
 
structur e
 
Observations
 
are
 
organized
 
by
 
country
 
and
 
year
 
with
 
attributes
 
such
 
as
 
Iso3_code,
 
Region,
 
Subregion,
 
Country ,
 
Source,
 
Dimension
 
(e.g.,
 
by
 
citizenship),
 
Category
 
(e.g.,
 
National
 
citizens,
 
Foreign
 
citizens,
 
Total),
 
Sex
 
(Male/Female/T otal),
 
Age
 
(often
 
Total),
 
Year,
 
Unit
 
of
 
measurement,
 
and
 
value.
 
The
 
time
 
span
 
covers
 
roughly
 
1990–2022,
 
enabling
 
long
 
term
 
trend
 
analysis.
 
Sour ce
 
UNODC’ s
 
series
 
integrates
 
criminal
 
justice
 
data
 
(law
 
enforcement
 
and
 
court
 
records)
 
and
 
public
 
health
 
data
 
(vital
 
registration/causes
 
of
 
death).
 
 
Questions
 
for
 
EDA
 
1.
 
Which
 
countries
 
have
 
the
 
highest
 
and
 
lowest
 
homicide
 
rates
 
(per
 
100,000
 
population)
 
in
 
the
 
most
 
recent
 
year
 
available?
 
2.
 
How
 
has
 
the
 
global
 
homicide
 
rate
 
(or
 
total
 
counts)
 
changed
 
over
 
time
 
for
 
the
 
'World'
 
region?
 
3.
 
How
 
do
 
homicide
 
rates
 
compare
 
across
 
the
 
five
 
major
 
regions
 
(Americas,
 
Europe,
 
Asia,
 
Africa,
 
Oceania)?
 
4.
 
How
 
concentrated
 
are
 
global
 
counts—what
 
share
 
of
 
total
 
homicides
 
occur
 
in
 
the
 
top
 
10
 
countries
 
each
 
year?
 
5.
 
What
 
is
 
the
 
distribution
 
of
 
homicide
 
by
 
mechanisms
 
(e.g.,
 
'Firearms
 
or
 
explosives',
 
'Another
 
weapon')
 
globally
 
or
 
by
 
a
 
specific
 
region?
 
6.
 
Is
 
there
 
a
 
significant
 
difference
 
in
 
crime
 
rates
 
(either
 
total
 
or
 
homicide)
 
between
 
male
 
and
 
female
 
victims?
 
7.
 
Which
 
age
 
group
 
has
 
the
 
highest
 
number
 
of
 
homicide
 
victims
 
in
 
the
 
dataset?
 
8.
 
For
 
a
 
given
 
country ,
 
how
 
does
 
the
 
proportion
 
of
 
homicides
 
committed
 
by
 
intimate
 
partners
 
or
 
family
 
members
 
compare
 
to
 
those
 
committed
 
by
 
unknown
 
perpetrators?
 
9.
 
How
 
do
 
the
 
crime
 
statistics
 
differ
 
between
 
'National
 
citizens'
 
and
 
'Foreign
 
citizens'
 
across
 
a
 
selected
 
set
 
of
 
European
 
countries?
 
10.
 
What
 
is
 
the
 
distribution
 
of
 
VALUE
 
(counts)
 
across
 
all
 
observations,
 
and
 
where
 
are
 
the
 
outliers?
